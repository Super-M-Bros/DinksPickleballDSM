                By day, Bill is a pilot for FedEx. Often times he is based out of Indianapolis and where his work merged
                with
                pickleball. While traveling and on call, Bill quickly got hooked on pickleball about 5 yrs ago and made
                many
                friends in the pickleball community both in Indiana and Iowa. 2 years ago this led to founding and
                operating
                an
                indoor pickleball court, “The Hideout” in Indianapolis. When Bill’s not flying or playing pickleball, he
                stays
                busy playing golf, hunting, snowmobiling, playing bags and even mentored a local Eagle Scout who built 2
                pickleball courts for his final project!
                <br>

                in
                her
                community. While she is still new to pickleball and it hasn’t completely taken all of her free time yet,
                she
                keeps busy golfing, reading, scrapbooking, gardening and hiking.

                David and Bailey started playing pickleball about 5 years ago after Bailey’s parents, Kirk and Beth
                Meints
                introduced them to the sport. Like most, once we started playing we quickly became addicted. We even
                took a
                family cruise with Engage Pickleball for a week of pickleball training which introduced us to the
                founders
                of
                Engage. David continues to play for Team Engage as a sponsored player. Pickleball has had a huge,
                positive
                impact on our lives making so many life long friends, allowing us to travel many states for tournaments
                and
                provides an outlet for our competitiveness! Our whole family family will be heading to Texas in November
                to
                support Bailey who will be playing 5.0 Women’s doubles at Nationals.
                <br>

                area.
                <br>

                Outside of Dinks, David works full time as a Regional Sales Manager for a Cyber Security Start Up
                covering
                Enterprise Accounts across 16 states and enjoys coaching both his girls Soccer team.

                Campbell & Lolo are Dinks VPs of Youth Experience. While they are up and coming pickleball stars - they

                <br>
                <br>
                We could not be more excited to open Dinks and in addition to 13 dedicated courts - provide training,
                tournaments, leagues, events and most of all a central hub for the Des Moines Pickleball community!!
